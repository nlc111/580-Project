Airline Crew Pairing Reverse Optimization
Set Partitioning Workflow (SPP)

This repository implements a set partitioning approach to airline crew pairing selection. Given a large set of feasible crew pairings, the goal is to choose a minimum-cost subset such that each flight leg is covered exactly once.

The project is organized as a data-to-model pipeline:

Parse and normalize pairing data

Analyze and predict schedule costs. Different cost modeling strategies are implemented

Build the leg–pairing incidence structure

Generate additional pairs from previous known solutions

Solve the resulting Set Partitioning Problem (SPP) using integer programming

The modular structure makes it easy to swap in new pairing generators, cost models, or solvers without rewriting the entire pipeline.

Notes

This repository focuses on the pairing selection problem, not the generation of legal pairings themselves. 
It is intended as a research-oriented and instructional implementation of SPP methods applied to airline crew scheduling.
